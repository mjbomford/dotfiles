* This is my attempt at organizing my emacs configuration
So far, so good. Because this is not escaped it should serve for some kind of highly personal literate programming.
** About packages and their locations
When you M-x package-list-packages you get relative locations for the package files.
They are (as is correct) found in ~/.emacs.d/elpa/
But right now the only one I've installed is org, which is "shadowing a built-in package" (whatever that means)

* Turn off menu bar
This works.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

* Unicode by default
This works even if it might not be in the right place. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC

* Wrap long lines by default
I'm not sure I want to do this because it makes org mode tables too ugly. That's ok because it doesn't work anyways.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-default 'truncate-lines nil)
#+END_SRC

* Let's learn about org-mode exporters since v 8.0
