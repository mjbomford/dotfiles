* This is my attempt at organizing my emacs configuration
So far, so good. Because this is not escaped it should serve for some kind of highly personal literate programming.

* Turn off menu bar
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

* Wrap long lines by default
That was copied and pasted, I wonder why syntax highlighting did not work.
(Because there was a syntax error - but the default switch didn't seem to work in any event, I wonder why.)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; this one came from "Visual Line Mode"
(setq line-move-visual nil)
(set-default 'truncate-lines t)
#+END_SRC
